Hi, I’m Iris Foxfoot :fox_face: 

I'm currently an Environmental Data Scientist/Research Scientist at the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, where I work on the Ecological Modeling Team. I love making maps, using statistics to discover new things, and coding in R and Python. I also enjoy spending time in nature, being creative, and snowboarding!

## What I've been working on

- I developed the `fqacalc` and `fqadata` R packages to calculate Floristic Quality Assessment metrics.
- I'm building agent-based models using the `mesa` framework in Python and the `netlogo` modeling environment.
- I recently completed my master's degree in Environmental Science at UCSB, where I focused on equity in wildfire planning.
